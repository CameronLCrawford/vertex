# History
When I was 15, I built [Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU](https://eater.net/8bit/).
When I was 16, I wanted to build something more powerful.
I decided to build my iteration on Ben's CPU in code, as breadboards were expensive.
I read Nisan and Schocken's [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book).
I then read the [Programmer's guide for the Intel 8080](https://altairclone.com/downloads/manuals/8080%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf).
I designed and built my contraption in C++.
I designed a rudimentary language and built a compiler in Python.
I didn't know what 'recursive descent' was, but I didn't care;
sometimes a program would get 'stuck' while compiling and I'd just write something else.
When I was 18, I wrote about what I had built and got into [university](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk).
When I was 21, I graduated in Computer Science and started my first job in software.
I now now what 'recursive descent' is.
This project still fascinates me, 6 years on.
I'm going to try again.
